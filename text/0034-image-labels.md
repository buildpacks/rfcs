# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Buildpacks should be able to expose arbitrary label metadata on images.  This content should be exposed by enhancing buildpack artifacts.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

While buildpacks create OCI images, the standard does not expose all elements that OCI images can support to buildpack authors.  One of these elements, [image labels][l], is regularly requested by users in order to contribute both [standard][s] and arbitrary metadata to their generated images.  Once delivered, this functionality would let buildpack authors contribute labels to the images their buildpacks create.

As an example, the Spring Boot team would like to expose the properties an application can be configured with as an `org.springframework.boot.spring-configuration-metadata.json` label on an image.  The contents of this label are the contents of a file within the application.  By allowing a buildpack to automate the addition of the label to the image, it removes the need for a user to do it manually for each application and each build.

# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

Buildpacks must be able to contribute arbitrary key-value pairs that will be placed as labels on images.  This can be added as a non-breaking change to `launch.toml` as a peer to `processes` and `slices`. It should be comprised of a collection of items, each with `key` and `value` entries.

```toml
[[labels]]
key = "<label key 1>"
value = "<label value 1>"

[[labels]]
key = "<label key 2>"
value = "<label value 2>"
```

Buildpack users will likely want to be able to contribute labels directly as well, but exposure of that functionality should be a platform-concern and implemented in a UX-native way by each platform rather than being standardized.  A buildpack that allows contribution via user-configuration could be used as a stop-gap solution until a platform supports UX-native contribution and as the only solution for platforms that never do.

# How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works

The collected contents of the `labels` entries contributed by each buildpack should be contributed to the image's `.Config.Labels` collection.

There's no reason not to do this.

This is a straightforward community request and no other designs have been considered.

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

It is possible that given arbitrary labeling, some or all of the BOM might be migrated to labels.  At this time, without a comprehensive story around contributed dependencies, trying to describe that migration isn't appropriate.  It should be kept in mind as another possible step once this has been accepted.

# Spec. Changes (OPTIONAL)
[spec-changes]: #spec-changes

Changes to `launch.toml` are required as part of this RFC.  A collection of `labels` objects consisting of `key` and `value` fields will be added.
