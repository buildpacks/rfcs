# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

This proposal makes it easier to write a simple buildpack that respects user-provided environment variables.

# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

This RFC proposes that user-provided environment variable be loaded by default. This should make it easier to write a simple buildpack that passes along arbitrary build-time environment variables.

# How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works

User-provided build-time environment variables are loaded in the detection and build environment automatically unless `clear-env = true` is specified in the buildpack's entry in `buildpack.toml`. In both cases, the environment variables continue to be available in `<platform>/env/`.

If any [lifecycle-provided env var](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/master/buildpack.md#provided-by-the-lifecycle) is specified by the user, and `clear-env = true` is not set, then the user-provided value is prepended immediately before each `/bin/build` invocation, so that the value precedes any layer-provided values.

The `<platform>` directory argument feels unnecessary in the default case.

Keep current environment variable behavior.
