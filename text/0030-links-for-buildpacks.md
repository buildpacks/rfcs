# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC suggest a mechanism where buildpacks can provide arbitrary links in their configuration: point to a homepage. These links are intended to contain documentation, point to github repos, point users to readmes, etc. but should not prescribe a format.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

At the moment the origin and provenance of a buildpack are sort of a black box. Users have asked where to find information about the repos for buildpacks so they can file issues, but we would also like a method to allow buildpacks to surface their configuration options or anything else their authors think pertinent. Without prescribing a format for this need broadly, we should have a mechanism for buildpack authors to include a link they can pass to their users.

# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

Add an additional, optional, field to `buildpack.toml` -  `homepage`.
Expand the `io.buildpacks.buildpackage.metadata` to include `homepage` if it is provided in `buildpack.toml`.

# How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works

This link would be available for platforms to display, for example `pack inspect-builder BUILDER` would dump these links like so:
```text
Buildpacks:
  ID                                                VERSION         HOMEPAGE
  org.cloudfoundry.azureapplicationinsights         v1.1.9          https://github.com/cloudfoundry/azure-application-insights-cnb

```

 Inclusion of this link would allow buildpack authors to provide a pointer to arbitrary information for their consumers.

 A `buildpack.toml` for the above buildpack would look like:

 ```toml
api = "0.2"

[buildpack]
id = "org.cloudfoundry.azureapplicationinsights"
version = "1.1.9"
homepage = "https://github.com/cloudfoundry/azure-application-insights-cnb" # <- New optional field

 ```

Too generic a pointer?

- A `docs` field containing markdown.

- Cargo.toml: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html supports a homepage
