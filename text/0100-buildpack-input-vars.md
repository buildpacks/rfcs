# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This is a proposal to replace the positional arguments of Buildpack executables with named environment variables.

# Definitions
[definitions]: #definitions

- *positional arguments* - values passed into an executable command such that they are accessible as `$1`, `$2`, etc

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Postional arguments to Buildpack executables have been the way for the buildpack execution engine to provide inputs for buildpacks since buildpacks v1 was created. However, positional arguments are limiting, and what they represent is not obvious without reading the spec.

In the spec today they are defined as:

* `/bin/detect <platform[AR]> <plan[E]>`
* `/bin/build <layers[EIC]> <platform[AR]> <plan[ER]>`

Using env vars helps make these inputs more easily accesible from language bindings like [libcnb.bash](https://github.com/jkutner/libcnb.bash).

# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

We will deprecate the positional arguments to `bin/detect` and `bin/build` with the following environment variables:

### bin/detect

* `CNB_PLATFORM_DIR` - replaces the first positional argument to `bin/detect`. Uses the same env var name as the Platform spec.
* `CNB_BUILD_PLAN_PATH` - replaces the second positional argument to `bin/detect`. Uses the same env var name as the Platform spec.

### bin/build

* `CNB_LAYERS_DIR` - replaces the first positional argument to `bin/build`. **Note:** Uses the same env var name as the Platform spec, but refers to a different location.
* `CNB_PLATFORM_DIR` - replaces the second positional argument to `bin/build`. Uses the same env var name as the Platform spec.
* `CNB_BP_PLAN_PATH` - replaces the third positional argument to `bin/build`.

# How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works

Provide the environment variables with the same mechanism used to provide `CNB_BUILDPACK_DIR`. For example in [lifecycle's `build.go`](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/blob/880a801db2d4bfbb39671a66f7aadd96c0231e37/buildpack/build.go):

```go
cmd.Env = append(cmd.Env, EnvPlatformDir+"="+b.Dir)
```

The positional arguments will be deprecated, but no warnings will be emitted if they are consumed. The lifecycle will continue to provide them to buildpack executable indefinitely, with no plan to remove them.

## Renaming Platform Env Vars

Because `CNB_LAYERS_DIR` in the new input vars conflicts with a platform env var name, we intend to rename the platform env var as part of a larger effort to refactor the platform spec. That will be convered in a future RFC.

The conflict of env var names is strictly an experience problem. Because the env vars are used in different contexts, there is little risk that they will be reused by the internals of lifecycle or pack.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- People have been using positional arguments to buildpacks for literally a decade
- New env var names conflict with platform env vars

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Do this but don't deprecate the positional arguments (support both)

# Prior Art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

- Buildpack v1, v2a, & v2b
