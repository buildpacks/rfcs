# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Previously the Cloud Native Buildpacks project created a [Bindings Extension Specification][cnb].  This specification was intended to be an incubator for bindings generally and the hope was that it would be adopted by a broader ecosystem.  This has now come to pass with the [Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes][k8s].

Given this broader specification, the Cloud Native Buildpacks Bindings Extension Specification should be deprecated and eventually removed in favor of the Kubernetes version.

- The Specification should be clearly marked as deprecated with an anticipated removal date six months from its designation as deprecated.
- A reference to the Kubernetes specification should be added to the [Platform Additional Guidance Section][p].
- A reference to the Cloud Native Buildpacks specification with a warning that both should be supported during deprecation, should be added to the [Platform Additional Guidance Section][p].
- A reference to the Kubernetes specification should be added to a new [Buildpack Additional Guidance Secion][b].
- A reference to the Cloud Native Buildpacks specification with a warning that both should be supported during deprecation, should be added to a new [Buildpack Additional Guidance Secion][b].
