# Summary
[summary]: #summary
Create a new repo called “stackify” which can be used to turn OCI images into CNB compliant stack images.

# Definitions
[definitions]: #definitions
N/A

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation
Currently, for users to extend the published stack images, or turn their own images into stack images, they have to create Dockerfiles which take the base images, apply their changes, and then set the CNB metadata. It can be difficult to generate and set all of the relevant metadata, especially the mixins.

Stackify will be a tool that they can use to perform all of these manipulations to their base image without Dockerfiles.


# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is
Stackify will be a tool that will be useful to users who would like to customize the published stack images or turn their own base images into CNB compliant stack images.

Users can use stackify to add packages and ca-certificates to a base image as well as add all required CNB metadata to the image.

Stackify can be integrated into Pack in the form of a `pack stack create` command.

# How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works
For stacks defined by the buildpacks project, Stackify will add mixin labels for each package installed on the image. If Stackify is used to add a stack ID other than one defined by the buildpacks project, mixin labels will not be added.

If Stackify is used with an already valid stack image, the `CNB_*` labels and users will not be changed unless new user and group ID's are passed, in which case the labels and user will be overwritten.

If run on the image being "stackify-ed", Stackify can be used to add packages and ca-certificates.

Stackify will use Kaniko to create additional image layers with the additional packages and ca-certificates that users choose to add to their base image. It will also use GGCR to manipulate the image metadata.


### Proposed Interface
Stackify will be run once for each image (build and run):
```
stackify 
  --base-image string
      Source image ref
  --destination string
      Destination for stack image
  --stack-id string
      Stack ID to add to image metadata
  --certs-dir string
      Path to directory with CA Certs to add to image
  --mixin-labels string
      Comma-separated list of mixins to add to labels
  --packages string
      Comma-separated list of packages to add to image
  --user-id string
      CNB User ID
  --group-id string
      CNB Group ID
  --build
      Add build image metadata (must specify either --build or --run)
  --run
      Add run image metadata (must specify either --build or --run)
```

This will be called under the hood by the `pack stack create` command, which will take a TOML config file. Pack will have to copy the stackify image onto each base image and then run stackify with the specified inputs for each image.

This command can be invoked by passing in `--run-image`, `--build-image`, or both, depending on which images you would like to have created.

`pack stack create my-stack --run-image <run-tag> --build-image <build-tag> -c /path/to/config.toml`

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks
* Stackify must be run on the image being "stackify-ed" in order to add ca-certificates and packages.
  * Pack has to run stackify within the image that is being modified.
* If we do not do enough validation, users may be able to successfully use stackify with incompatible or invalid base images.
* Some of the CNB metadata can be difficult to generate, particularly the mixins

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives
* Without this tool users can still use Dockerfiles to extend base images and add the CNB metadata.
    * However, this requires them to be aware of all of the relevant metadata needed on the image and maintain a Dockerfile to continuously update their images.

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions
* How much validation should be done on the images, if any?
* It will be challenging to generate a list of common mixins between the build and run images. Is it ok that we will just have `build:<mixin>` and `run:<mixin>` labels and no shared mixins?
