# Summary
[summary]: #summary

We should use email more frequently to communicate important information about the project.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The CNCF uses email as its primary means of communicating information. As a good citizen of this community, we should follow in this example.

Furthermore, other mediums like Slack lack a history that is both durable, generally searchable, and easily linkable (i.e. you don't need a Slack account to view the information).

# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

We are proposing that we use email messages to notify the community of the following:

- RFCs entering Final Comment Period
- New releases of lifecycle and pack
- Changes to the governance structure, core team, maintainers, etc

We may communicate other information over email, but we consider these essential.
