# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Remove `run` command from the pack CLI

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Built images can already be run with `docker` or with a container orchestrator like Kubernetes.
`pack run` does not expose many of the runtime options users desire.
 Users may initially assume that `pack run` is analogous to `docker run` and be surprised to discover that it rebuilds the image.
 For these reasons `pack run` adds maintenance burden without significant value.
