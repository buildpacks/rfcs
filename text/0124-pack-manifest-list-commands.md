# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The problem for adding support for multi-arch buildpacks can be divided into two parts:
- Support buildpack authors to **migrate their existing buildpacks** to support multi-arch .
- Support buildpack authors to **create new buildpacks and builders** that handle multi-arch from the beginning.

This RFC proposes to create a new set of CRUD commands in pack to handle manifest lists, which will be used to support the first part of the problem.

# Definitions
[definitions]: #definitions

- Image Manifest: The image manifest provides a configuration and set of layers for a single container image for a specific architecture and operating system. See [spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md)
- Image Index: The image index is a higher-level manifest which points to specific image manifests, ideal for one or more platforms. See [spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md)

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

- Why should we do this?

The uses of ARM architecture in the cloud and edge computing has been growing rapidly. The CNCF community has been also growing in the last years, and there is a need to support multi-arch for all the projects. The buildpacks community is not an exception, issues like:
- [It would be nice to support easily creating a manifest list packages and builders](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/issues/1460)
- [Provide a way to specify desired platform when creating packages and builders](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/issues/1459)
- [Multi arch image build support](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/issues/1570)

Or the conversations around this topic in our [slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C032LNSMY0P), even the [talk at Kubecon NA 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdr5axlOnDI&list=PLj6h78yzYM2O5aNpRM71NQyx3WUe1xpTn&index=76) demonstrate the interest from the community in this feature.

- What use cases does it support?

Currently, buildpack authors can build and package their buildpacks for different OS and Architectures, but when they distribute them the URI for a buildpack canâ€™t disambiguate, they need to use different tags to differentiate between them. This makes harder for users to consume those Buildpacks.
The solution is to share a single URI for all the different OS and Architectures, and the way to do that is using a manifest list.

Adding commands to support the operations to handle the manifest list will allow buildpack authors to migrate their existing buildpacks to support multi-arch, without afecting their current existing process.

- What is the expected outcome?

The expected outcome is to have a set of commands in pack to handle manifest lists, for example:
- A command to create a manifest list from a set of images
- A command to push the manifest list to a registry
- A command to update or delete a manifest list

# What it is
[what-it-is]: #what-it-is

The proposal is to add a new _experimental_ command `pack manifest` and different subcommands.   The `pack manifest` commands will initially be gated behind `pack config experimental`.  The `pack manifest` commands will move from experimental status to supported status when maintainers deem it appropriate.
- `pack manifest create` will create a local manifest list for annotating and pushing to a registry
- `pack manifest annotate` will add additional information like os, arch or variant to an existing local manifest list
- `pack manifest add` will add an image to an existing manifest list
- `pack manifest remove` will delete a manifest list from local storage
- `pack manifest rm` will remove an image from a manifest list in the local storage
- `pack manifest push` will push a manifest list to a registry
- `pack manifest inspect` will show the manifest information stored in local storage

Our target user affected by the feature is: **Buildpack Authors**. Let's see some examples of how this feature will work.

Currently, if we check [sample-packages](https://hub.docker.com/r/cnbs/sample-package/tags) at dockerhub we will notice that we have a composed buildpack called `hello-universe` and we offer two tags to support different architectures:
- `cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe` for linux and
- `cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-windows`.


Let's suppose our linux version is called `cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-linux` to keep the same naming convention, but we will keep it as it is for simplicity. If we want to distribute the `hello-universe` buildpack for any **architecture/os/variant** combination we need to use a tool outside the CNB ecosystem to create a manifest list. With the proposed experimental commands on pack we can do:

```bash
$ pack manifest create cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe \
     cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe \

     cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-windows
```

By default, the command will create a manifest list in the local storage using the docker media types [Version 2 schema 2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/) with a content similar to:

```json
{
   "schemaVersion": 2,
   "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json",
   "manifests": [
      {
         "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
         "size": 226083,
         "digest": "sha256: 87a832fd6a8d6995d336c740eb6f3da015401a6e564fcbe95ee1bf37557a8225",
         "platform": {
            "os": "linux",
           "architecture": ""
         }
      },
      {
         "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
         "size": 226083,
         "digest": "sha256:670d62fbee841d256a706801a03be9c84d37fc2cd6ef7538a7af9985c3d2ed8b",
         "platform": {
            "os": "windows",
           "architecture": ""
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
The idea to save the manifest list locally is to allow the user to update the manifest before pushing it to a registry,

in this case, we need to define the **architecture** field because it is empty in our examples.

We can use the `pack manifest annotate` command to add the architecture information:

```bash
$  pack manifest annotate --arch amd64 cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe
$  pack manifest annotate --arch amd64 cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-windows
```

After executing these commands, our local manifest list will be updated as follows:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json",
  "manifests": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
      "size": 940,
      "digest": "sha256:87a832fd6a8d6995d336c740eb6f3da015401a6e564fcbe95ee1bf37557a8225",
      "platform": {
        "architecture": "amd64",
        "os": "linux"
      }
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
      "size": 1148,
      "digest": "sha256:670d62fbee841d256a706801a03be9c84d37fc2cd6ef7538a7af9985c3d2ed8b",
      "platform": {
        "architecture": "amd64",
        "os": "windows"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, our manifest list is ready to be pushed to a registry, and we can use the `pack manifest push` command to do it:

```bash
$ pack manifest push cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe
```
And our manifest list should be published at [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cnbs/sample-package/tags) as `cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe`, asuming that we have the proper credentials to push the image.

# How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works

The proposal is to implement an abstraction of an OCI *Image Index* and expose it to users through `pack manifest` commands.

## Image Index Abstraction

A new high level abstraction to represent an OCI Image Index is proposed, similar to the [Image](https://github.com/buildpacks/imgutil/blob/main/image.go) interface exposed in *imgutil* repository,

we proposed a new *ManifestList* interface to expose the behavior of an OCI Image Index.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ManifestList {
       <<interface>>
        +Add(repoName string) error
        +Remove(repoName string) error
        +Delete(additionalNames []string) error
        +AnnotateManifest(manifestName string, opts AnnotateFields) error
        +Save() error
    }

    class remote_ManifestList {
        +NewManifestList(repoName string, keychain authn.Keychain) ManifestList

    }

    class local_ManifestList {
         +NewManifestList(repoName string, path string) ManifestList
    }


    class AnnotateFields {
         +String Architecture
         +String OS
         +String Variant
    }

    ManifestList <|-- remote_ManifestList
    ManifestList <|-- local_ManifestList

```

Two implementations: *remote* and *local* are proposed, *remote* will take care of implementing the interaction with an OCI registry and *local* will deal with the local storage operations.

### Component Diagram

Using a [C4 component diagram](https://c4model.com/#ComponentDiagram), we can define the high level interaction on pack. This design follows the same pattern for each command already implemented.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1PpJ-fKh.png)

- *Image Factory*: is responsible for instantiate the *Image Index* abstraction based on the configuration require, it could be a *remote* or a *local* implementation
- *Image Index*: is the abstraction defined which exposes the operation methods we want to offer to users
  - As we can see, depending on the implementation it will interact with the file system or with a remote registry

### Considerations

#### When a user wants to create a manifest list using a manifest outside the user's repo.


As a pack user I want to create a manifest list `foo/my-manifest:my-tag` using a manifest outside my repository `foo` for example `other/external-manifest:latest`.

The user invokes a command similar to: `pack manifest create foo/my-manifest:my-tag other/external-manifest:latest`

In this case, pack will need to *copy* the external image `other/external-manifest:latest` into `foo` repository `foo/external-manifest:latest` and then uses this reference to create the manifest list. In such as case `pack` should:
 - *warn* the user about this operation, for example with a message
 - *ask the user for confirmation* before executing the operation

#### When a user wants to create a manifest list referencing a manifest list

As a pack user I want to create a manifest list using a reference to another manifest list

The user invokes a command similar to: `pack manifest create foo/my-manifest:my-tag foo/another-manifest:latest`

In this case, pack should:
 - add into the **manifests** array of objects a reference to the manifest index using the media-type `application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json` (nested index)

### Commands details

#### Create a Manifest List

Pack will create a manifest a local manifest, it should handle the following scenarios:
- IF user references a manifest list that already exists in a registry: In this case, pack will save a local copy of the remote manifest list, this is useful for updating (adding, updating or deleting) images
- IF user references a manifest list that doesn't exist in a registry: pack will create a local representation of the manifest list that will only save on the remote registry if the user publish it

```bash
manifest create generates a manifest list for a multi-arch image

Usage:
  pack manifest create <manifest-list> <manifest> [<manifest> ... ] [flags]

Examples:
pack manifest create cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe \
					cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe \
					cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-windows

Flags:
  -f, --format string     Format to save image index as ("OCI" or "V2S2") (default "v2s2")
      --insecure          Allow publishing to insecure registry
      --publish           Publish to registry
  -r, --registry string   Registry URL to publish the image index
```

#### Annotate (os/arch) a Manifest List


Sometimes a manifest list could reference an image that doesn't specify the *architecture*, for example, [check](https://hub.docker.com/r/cnbs/sample-package/tags) our sample buildpack
packages. The `annotate` command allows users to update those values before pushing the manifest list a registry

```bash
manifest annotate modifies a manifest list (Image index) and update the platform information for an image included in the manifest list.

Usage:
  pack manifest annotate [OPTIONS] <manifest-list> <manifest> [flags]

Examples:
pack manifest annotate cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-multiarch \ cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe --arch amd64

Flags:
      --arch string      Set the architecture
      --os string        Set the operating system
      --variant string   Set the architecture variant
```

#### Add an image to a Manifest List

When a manifest list exits locally, user can add a new image to the manifest list using this command

```bash
manifest add modifies a manifest list (Image index) and add a new image to the list of manifests.

Usage:
  pack manifest add [OPTIONS] <manifest-list> <manifest> [flags]

Examples:
pack manifest add cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe \
					cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-riscv-linux

Flags:
      --all              add all of the contents to the local list (applies only if <manifest> is an index)
      --arch string      Set the architecture
      --os string        Set the operating system
      --variant string   Set the architecture variant
```

#### Remove an image from a Manifest List

In the opposite case, users can remove existing images from a manifest list

```bash
Delete one or more manifest lists from local storage

Usage:
  pack manifest remove [manifest-list] [manifest-list...] [flags]

Examples:
pack manifest delete cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for 'remove'
```

#### Remove a local Manifest List

Sometimes users can just experiment with the feature locally and they want to discard all the local information created by pack. `rm` command just delete the *local* manifest list

```bash
manifest remove will remove the specified image manifest if it is already referenced in the index

Usage:
  pack manifest rm [manifest-list] [manifest] [flags]

Examples:
pack manifest rm cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe \
					cnbs/sample-package:hello-universe-windows

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for 'rm'

```

#### Push a Manifest List to a remote registry

Once a manifest list is ready to be publishe into the registry, the `push` command can be used

```bash
manifest push pushes a manifest list (Image index) to a registry.

Usage:
  pack manifest push [OPTIONS] <manifest-list> [flags]

Examples:
pack manifest push cnbs/sample-package:hello-multiarch-universe

Flags:
  -f, --format string   Manifest list type (oci or v2s2) to use when pushing the list (default is v2s2)
      --insecure        Allow publishing to insecure registry
  -p, --purge           Delete the manifest list or image index from local storage if pushing succeeds
```

#### Inspect a Manifest List

Finally, the `inspect` command will help users to view how their local manifest list looks like

```bash
manifest inspect shows the manifest information stored in local storage

Usage:
  pack manifest inspect <manifest-list> [flags]

Examples:
pack manifest inspect cnbs/sample-builder:multiarch

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for 'inspect'

```

One important concern for users is to inspect the content of a multi-arch builder or buildpack if they are accessible behind a manifest list. The proposal is to implement a `platform` flag for commands:

- `pack builder inspect`
- `pack buildpack inspect`

The `--platform` flag specifies the platform in the form os/arch[/variant][:osversion] (e.g. linux/amd64). By default it will reference the host values.

The output of the commands should remain the same.


# Migration
[migration]: #migration

This section should document breaks to public API and breaks in compatibility due to this RFC's proposed changes. In addition, it should document the proposed steps that one would need to take to work through these changes. Care should be give to include all applicable personas, such as platform developers, buildpack developers, buildpack users and consumers of buildpack images.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

We should decide to do not add this feature and users could use tools like `docker` or `podman` to create and handle their manifest list, however this is a poor user experience forcing users to use different tools to fulfill scenarios that are part of the business domain of pack.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- What other designs have been considered?

We also have in mind to improve existing commands like `pack builder create` and `pack buildpack package` to support the creation of a manifest list without the need of a new command. However, this approach could not be suitable for buildpack authors who are maintaining existing buildpacks and they will need to change their current process to generate multi-arch images.

- Why is this proposal the best?

Because we will provide the tool to our end users to solve their problems without the need of using other tools.

- What is the impact of not doing this?

The impact of not doing this is that users will need to use other tools to create and handle their manifest list, which is a poor user experience.

# Prior Art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

These features are inspired in similar commands in other tools like:
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/)
- [podman](https://docs.podman.io/en/v3.2.0/markdown/podman-manifest-create.1.html)

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to be resolved before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to be resolved through implementation of the feature?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Spec. Changes (OPTIONAL)
[spec-changes]: #spec-changes
Does this RFC entail any proposed changes to the core specifications or extensions? If so, please document changes here.
Examples of a spec. change might be new lifecycle flags, new `buildpack.toml` fields, new fields in the buildpackage label, etc.
This section is not intended to be binding, but as discussion of an RFC unfolds, if spec changes are necessary, they should be documented here.
