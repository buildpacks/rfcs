# How it Works
[how-it-works]: #how-it-works

# Spec. Changes (OPTIONAL)
[spec-changes]: #spec-changes
Does this RFC entail any proposed changes to the core specifications or extensions? If so, please document changes here.
Examples of a spec. change might be new lifecycle flags, new `buildpack.toml` fields, new fields in the buildpackage label, etc.
This section is not intended to be binding, but as discussion of an RFC unfolds, if spec changes are necessary, they should be documented here.
